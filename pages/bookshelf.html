            <h4>Berserk Vol. 1-43 by Kentaro Miura</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            Absolute masterpiece. The tragedy, themes surrounding predeterminism and free will, character arcs, and action is incredible and unmatched.
            I can't wait to read the rest of the story as it comes out, hopefully it remains a similar quality despite Miura's unfortunate death.

            <h4>Vagabond Vol. 1-5 by Takehiko Inoue</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            Really awesome so far, feels like a similar level of writing and illustration to Berserk. Its just getting better and better. I loved the arc with Inshun,
            so incredible. Will update this as I read more.

            <h4>H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth (Manga) by Gou Tanabe</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            This was really enjoyable. I wasn't sure if the illustrations could live up to the insane descriptions Lovecraft sometimes gives, but
            I really felt like they added to the story. I'd love to read more of Gou Tanabe's Lovecraft adaptations.

            <h4>Claymore Vol. 1 by Norihiro Yagi</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            I enjoyed this enough to want to read more of Claymore. It was missing a feeling of purpose that Berserk or Vagabond have, but it
            had people with big swords killing monsters so that's pretty fun.

            <h4>Uzumaki by Junji Ito</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            I really expected to love this. It was fun for the first few chapters, but then the fun really faded. Nearly every story was identical
            in structure and content with each one just drawn differently. The artwork is amazing, but how many times do I need to read "I saw a spiral uh oh" 
            and then "he turned into a monster and then died". Overall the illustration is incredible but storytelling is lackluster. I liked the ending in the
            final chapter though.
