            I felt like I was going to be executed doing this problem. Everything was sharp and the top out was tough, but the 
            campus start and the high heel hooks were so fun, I loved coming up with and doing this one. I'll definitely try it 
            again next time I'm in Catoctin to make sure V4 feels like the right grade.

            As far as I know and can tell, no one has climbed this entire face around the corner from the Neon boulder so Frankenweenie
            was just the easiest route I could find up the boulder. Each move felt really juggy and stable but the boulder is so dirty
            and the rock is so flaky I never felt certain the rock would hold me. This thing is tall and the landing isn't great.

            My first ever first ascent of a boulder (as far as I know). I can't be certain no one has ever done this before
            until other people check it out and let me know on mountain project so for now it counts. The holds felt very dusty 
            and unused so I doubt anyone has done this, at least not in a long time. Starts as a sit start
            on the big blade looking vertical slab/flake thing. Traverse left along it with basically no foot holds, just
            hands on the lip of the blade until you can reach up to the overhang above. From there just traverse left and
            top out the same way as Neon Milk. It felt really cool making up my own boulder problem and figuring it out as I 
            climbed it. Gave it the name Neon Guillotine Traverse since it starts on the big blade looking rock and finishes 
            with a traverse. Gave it a V1 grade because the most difficult portion was the start on the blade, but even that
            was easily done on my first attempt.

            This one is the same start as Neon Guillotine Traverse, the main difference is the top out. Rather than traversing
            left, top out towards the right where there are less holds and generally worse holds. The holds on the top out for 
            this one felt very dirty so I definitely doubt anyone has done this one. I gave it a V3 since the top out is much
            trickier than the traverse as you dont have any good footholds other than the blade until you make some big moves
            towards the top, but it might be closer to V2, I'll need to climb it again to be sure. I gave it a PG13 since if you
            fall on the crux you will likely land on the blade. Definitely need someone holding a crash pad over the blade while
            you climb to make it safe.

            This was a really cool V1 that started with a heel hook and went into some reachy moves to good crimps. The 
            top out was relatively scary cause the only decent hold at the top was a little slippery pebble and the landing
            was pretty terrible, but still super fun.

            Really awesome to get my first V4, but I kind of wish it was on a different problem. I did this one twice
            because the mountain project description didn't give great direction and I wanted to make sure I did it right.
            Both ways I did it, it just didnt feel that great until near the top. Some really cool tiny crimps and pinches
            on it though.

            Really glad I flashed this. Sit start on a jug into a sloper felt really cool. Cool sharp crimps in the middle 
            section and then finishing on V1-2 slab was great. The top out was probably the easiest section, but easily the scariest
            since you're relying heavily on your feet not slipping and making you fall ~25ft. Favorite climb I've ever done.

            My first ever outdoor boulder. Might be biased since it was my first boulder, but it was really fun. I normally

            This was the main problem I worked on during my first trip to Gretna. So much fun, the first move felt insane at first so I tried
            the rest, skipping the first move and topped out. After that I tried the first move again and got it immediately, but couldn't 
            actually link all of the moves, will definitely get it next time.

            Fun start with a heel hook and throwing for crimps. I feel like the crux was moving from the shallow pocket on the right up to
            the top out. I worked out all of the moves on this but didn't actually top it out since I was alone and definitely need a spotter
            for this one. The video is me working out what I felt was the crux, not a proper attempt from the start.

            I mostly wanted to try this because of its name, but the start was cool. I wish there were more videos of people doing this 
            one because the only beta I could figure out was just the beta for the V6 variation.

            Really sharp holds on this overhanging problem. I have the start down, but need to work on the middle 
            section. The start is a semi-dynamic reach to a nice crimp, really fun to do.

            The first few moves are easy but it can be tricky getting wide enough to get my left hand as high as possible on the arete. Then its difficult to
            walk your feet over since there aren't any decent footholds, just places to smear. It took me a few tries to get the first reach dialed in, but I 
            think the dynamic throw for the final hold will take a lot longer, but this feels so close.

            Super crimpy with long reaches. Only been able to do a few of the moves. Starts on tiny crimps with a 
            good heel hook. I think the start is the crux since holds are so tiny and its a big reach. Might need
            to try pulling harder with my heel.

            This is probably my favorite boulder problem I've ever attempted and I can't believe I didn't finish it. On my
            first attempt, I made it to the top out section, trying to get over the overhang, but I couldn't find where to 
            put my right hand, but watching videos back, all I needed to do was get my feet up a bit and then I could have
            easily finished it. Still amazing problem though, each hold was just a small pebble to pinch or crimp and it 
            required so much balance to stay on the wall. I would fly back to colorado just to try this one again.

            This was another great problem that I don't know how I didn't finish. I made it to the top out and all I had to do
            was move my left hand up and then get my feet up and there was plenty of great holds for both, but I think it was just 
            early in the day when I was trying it and I had brain fog up there. Pretty cool and powerful feeling moves on it though,
            would love to finish it someday.

            This entire boulder looks so insanely cool, but the moves on these two problems look the most fun. I would love to check it out,
            but the approach is long and I don't think I want to go out there until the winter or late fall when it'll be least overgrown. I 
            also want to wait until I can for sure make decent progress on these problems so I don't waste my time hiking out there.
