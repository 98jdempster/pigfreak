            This was my first ever multi-pitch and it was incredible. I've never done any trad climbing so Garrett lead every pitch and I'm so glad he did because
            the exposure at the top was insane. Looking down while climbing or belaying and realizing you're hundreds of feet from the ground is insane. None of it felt too scary 
            since I was on top rope, but I can't imagine leading it. The first pitch was a fun little 5.6, but it didn't fill me with much confidence when I somehow ended up 
            off-route slightly and had to hang for a second to figure out where I went wrong. The 2nd pitch was also there to humble me. It was only a 5.8, but I somehow 
            managed to use the absolute worst beta possible and make the crux feel insanely muscley and difficult when really there was a much simpler way to do it. Once that 
            nightmare pitch was over we did the last 2 pitches as 1 pitch and that was very easy despite the insane amount of exposure. I absolutely loved doing this, 
            but I fear I may still be a boulder bro at heart.

            Super fun route with interesting moves for a 5.8. This was also my tallest route at 70ft so it was really cool getting to the top and looking out 
            over the trees.

            This was my first outdoor lead route! Felt super smooth which wasn't too surprising given the grade, but the final move was shockingly difficult. Took me
            a few seconds to mentally prepare for it but it was just a no hands, high foot move up to a jug where you can clip the anchors. Strangely felt less scary
            than lead climbing in a gym.

            Most of this route felt pretty chill, especially being on top rope, but the moves from the last bolt to the anchors felt so hard. I rarely get to
            practice slab so thats probably a big part of it, but standing on super thin vertical edges with not so great hand holds was rough. I had to hang
            there a few times, but eventually got it.

            I made it to the second to last bolt on this one, but couldn't finish it. My feet were hurting from my new shoes and it was pretty hot at that
            point so I'm hoping that was the reason I couldn't finish it and I can do it easily next time, but we'll see.
